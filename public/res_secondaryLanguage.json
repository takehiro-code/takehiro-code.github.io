        "title": "Impact of Video Compression on Object Tracking Performance (thesis)",
        "startDate": "2021",
        "description": "A supervised thesis project completed in 2021 August in SFU Multimedia Lab. The goal was to research and quantify the video compression effect on object tracking accuracy. There has not been a detailed study of video compression effect on tracking accuracy due to the lack of uncompressed videos with tracking annotations (ground truth), and thus the goal in my project was to analyze such effect statistically in detail. I utilized a detection-based tracker that consists of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector YOLOv3 and tracking algorithm - Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT). High Efficiency Video Compression (HEVC) was utilized to compress the videos. Data was collected through the experiment pipeline from both uncompressed videos and compressed videos. I analyzed the data statiscally using multiple linear regresison (weighted least square) and t-test with the aid of visualization, and proposed the quantitative relationship of compression effect on tracking accuracy, given the available data. Through this thesis project, I learned the concept of machine learning, computer vision, video compression, and statistical methodolgies while getting used to the technical writing with LaTex.",

        "description": "CANnect, the automotive diagnostics application was built as a part of engineering capstone group project. Our application reads vehicle performance data from OBDII port in a vehicle, processes them through the hardware module, and displays them in the mobile app. We worked on the project in a 6-people group, and my role was to develop the android application using Android Studio with Java and XML. The data is Parameter IDs (PIDs) such as engine coolant temperature, vehicle speed, fuel pressure, etc. The data is visualized in a mobile app in a table, line chart, and meter visualization in real-time through Bluetooth. Through this project, I learned how to build an android application using Android Studio and got used to programming with Java and XML.",

The first video represents the solution to the double pendulum problem, solving a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using 10th order Gauss-Legendre integrator. The second image shows the solutions to the time independent Schrödinger's equation at a specific potential V(x) using again 10th order Gauss-Legendre method. The solutions, corresponding to the first 8 lowest eigenvalues (E0 to E7), psi(x) wave functions (or called eigenfucntions) and psi(x)^2 the probability distributions are shown. In this course, I learned how to solve problems including root-finding, optimization, ODE, PDE numerically while getting used to the programming languages Fortran and Bash. I used Gnuplot script to plot the results.",
